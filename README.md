 Building Generative AI Applications with Gradio
# AI-Driven Application with Mistral and Gradio

Welcome to the repository for an exciting AI-driven application developed using Mistral and Gradio. In this project, we've harnessed the power of open-source tools to create a user-friendly and versatile application.

## Application Overview

Our AI-driven application leverages the Mistral-7B-Instruct-v0.1 model, a state-of-the-art language model, to generate text-based responses. Gradio, an open-source Python library, provides an intuitive and interactive user interface for the application.

## Key Features

- Powered by the Mistral-7B-Instruct-v0.1 model.
- User-friendly interface created using Gradio.
- Supports various system instructions and language switching.
- Tested and implemented in Google Colab.

## Getting Started

To get started with this project, follow these steps:

1. Clone this repository to your local machine.
2. Set up the required environment and dependencies (details in the notebook).
3. Open and run the Jupyter notebook to explore the application.

## Course Recommendation

If you're interested in diving deeper into Gradio and AI application development, I highly recommend the ["Building Generative AI Applications with Gradio"](Course Link) course by Deeplearning.ai. It's a fantastic resource to enhance your skills and creativity.
